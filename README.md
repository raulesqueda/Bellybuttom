# Bellybutton

For this challenge, we help Roza after she partially completed the dashboard with Demographic information. Then, she needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the dashboard has to be able to identify the volunteers top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. With this, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
